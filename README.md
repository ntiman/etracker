## Description

This is my personal ionic framework project, the main idea of this app to track user's daily expenses and provide 
tips on how to save some money. This is not a finished solution, I am still in the process of development.

## What did I gain from developing this project: 

    - understanding of ionic framework
    - understanding of cross platform application development
    - java and angularJS practice
    - UI development experience
    - system analysis experience
