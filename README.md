## Description

This is my personal ionic framework project, the main idea is to track user's daily expenses and provide 
tips on how to save some money. This is not a finished solution, I am still in the process of development. 
Demonstration of what I currently have is provided here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efGIm05eEvI 


## What did I gain from developing this project: 

    - understanding of ionic framework
    - java and angularJS practice
    - UI development experience
    - system analysis experience
